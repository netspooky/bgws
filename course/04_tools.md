# Tools

We will be able to do most of the labs using only a text editor and xx, but there are some useful things that can help.

- A [Hex Editor](../reference/info_hexeditors.md) and/or Hex Dumper for viewing hex and manipulating hex.
- A Text Editor
- [File analyzer programs](../reference/info_tools.md)
- An [Assembler](../reference/info_assemblers.md) (Optional - For building files)
- [xx](../reference/info_xx.md) - Used to make annotated hex dumps and turn them into binary data

Once you have a comfy set up, you're ready for the labs!
